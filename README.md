### [Project 1: Body Mass Index](https://github.com/dayanacavalcante/Obesity-Estimate)
* Created a Linear Regression Model (MAE = 0.38) as an alternative to the formula that is used today, BMI = kg/m2, where kg is a person's weight in kilograms and m2 is their height in metres squared;
* Detect the groups of people at greatest health risk due to the level of obesity and the low (or zero) frequency of physical activity;
* Check which algorithm has the best performance for classification of Body Mass Index;
